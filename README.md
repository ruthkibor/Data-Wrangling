This project looks at the twitter account WeRateDogs.WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. 
These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." 
WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.ir followers to rate it by favoriting it. By asking WeRateDogs to share with us some of their tweets, they did. 
They have shared 5000+ of their tweets which contains some basic data. Sometimes in their brief panegyric they mention the breed of the dog, and some others they donâ€™t.
Udacity performed some neutral network procedures to classify the dogs based on their images which are shared with the tweets.

and manually. The datasets had several quality and tidiness issues such as missing data, some tweets not concerning dogs and having the datasets being three different sets when they could be one set.
